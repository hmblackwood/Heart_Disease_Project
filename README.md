# Summary:
- I created three machine learning models that determine whether someone has heart disease based on their other medical factors.
- Python libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn


##1. Problem
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can I predict whether or not they have heart disease?


##2. Data
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

##3. Machine Learning Model
- Models used:
  - Logistic regression
  - K Nearest Neighbors
  - Random Forest Classifier


##4. Evaluation
If I can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease, I will consider that a success.
I will evaluate the model using:
- ROC curve and AUC score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report that will include:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

## 5. Feature Importance
Which features of the data contributed most to the outcomes of the model?
