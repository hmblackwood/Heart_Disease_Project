Summary:<br>
Using Scikit-learn, I created three machine learning models that determine whether someone has heart disease based on their other medical factors.

Libraries Used:<br>
Python libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn


1. Problem:<br>
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can I predict whether or not they have heart disease?


2. Data:<br>
The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

3. Machine Learning Model:<br>
  - Models used:
    - Logistic regression
    - K Nearest Neighbors
    - Random Forest Classifier


4. Evaluation:<br>
If I can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease, I will consider that a success.
I will evaluate the model using:
  - ROC curve and AUC score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report that will include:
    - Precision
    - Recall
  - F1-score

5. Feature Importance:<br>
Determine which features of the data contributed most to the outcomes of the model?
